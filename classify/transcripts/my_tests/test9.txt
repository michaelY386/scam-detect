Hi I'm calling because I got a phone call from the IRS but I wasn't sure what it was about do you know what it might be?
Can you stay on the line, I will check it out.
Alright can you please confirm your first name?
My name is Emma, Emma Lauser.
I will read out the existing charges against your name okay?
Okay.
From 2012 to 2014 it looks like what you've filed doesn't match up with what you've earned and should be filing. According to section 101, you could go to jail for this offense and you will be banned from traveling until this matter is settled.
But what did I do wrong, I don't understand? 
There was a miscalculation okay? You owe $2,000 including legal fees and an arrest warrant is already under your name.
How did I accumulate so much I've been using a proper tax filing software and didn't realize this mistake was happening. What should I do?
Do you want to go to court or do you want to settle this with the IRS? 
I don't want to go to court but what choice do I have?
You have to pay this amount directly to us by wiring the money to an account we'll send to you through text.
