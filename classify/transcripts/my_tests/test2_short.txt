So you never received anything showing $5,821.00 sir?

Christine had said there was an outstanding fee of $5,000 and asked me to go to the bank, so I just walked down the street and I’m down in Santa Monica.  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with that stuff.

Can I explain you once again sir?

Okay, we have audit of your taxes between the year of 2009 and 2014.
And we find out that taxes amount to $5,821 which is late.
Right now you owe $5,821.
Now, when the case will be done within the courthouse,
your bank account will be seized, your credit report will be spoiled,
your passport along with State ID will be seized.

Okay, is this because of the Mazda Miata,
the convertible one or because I did not pay it?

This is sir, because you filed taxes but your taxes have
not been filed in correct for those years.  There was some
problem regarding a W-2 and W-4 form.  So now regarding a
W-2 and W-4 form unpaid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant
on your name.  And now for this unpaid taxes, once you get
arrested, your each and every property will be seized like
your house, your State ID your Visa, your driver's license.
Each and every property that belong to your name will be
seized by the IRS once you get arrested.
