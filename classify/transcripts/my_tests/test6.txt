Hey Aunt Jude, this is James, Ronald's son. 
Hello James, how are you? How's dad? What have you been up to?
I'm doing ok, school just started last month for the kids, so we've been busy with getting back into routine. Dad's doing fine. 
I just wanted to call because I know you're turning 68 next week, and I wanted to come visit this weekend. Are you free? Can Julie and I 
drop by with the kids? 
Of course. I'd love to have you over, kiddo. I haven't seen Julie in several months, how is she holding up with going back to work and 
handling the kids?
Oh, she - Aunt Jude, I'll have to call you back, would 7 o'clock be ok?
Sure thing, bye James.
