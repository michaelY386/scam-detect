Hello Liz, this is Mike from the senior center. How are you doing, Liz? I haven't seen you since June.
I've just come back from my holiday in Ireland.
Did you enjoy it?
I love Ireland. And the Irish people were so friendly. 
Did you go to the Wicklow Mountains?
It was my first trip. I can show you some pictures. Are you doing anything tomorrow?
I must arrange a couple of things. But I am free tonight.
You might come to my place. What time shall we meet? I'll be there at eight. Is it all right?
Sure, see you then.
