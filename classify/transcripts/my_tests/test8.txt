Hello Imalda, this is Roger from next door.
Oh hello Roger, is there something wrong?
No of course not. I just wanted to call and let you know that the postman dropped off a package for you while you were taking Lola for a 
walk. I think it may be the new hearing aid we order a couple weeks ago. Would you like me to bring it by?
Why thank you Roger, that would be great. I will see you soon.
