IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 2 of 17
Yes.

Okay. I mean, is it part of the IRS or something? State?

This is a legal Department working for Internal Revenue Service.

Okay. What do you mean by legal? You got me a little nervous

here. I'm trying to find out what's going on.

What is your native country, sir

I didn't hear you. What was that?

Which is your native country? Which country belong to originally?

Which country I belong to originally? I'm an American.

You have born and brought up an American?

I have what?

You have born and brought up in American?

Yeah. American.

All right. We don't call Americans, sir.

You don't call Americans? Okay.

Yes.

Then I'm really confused. Who do you call?

The people who evade taxes.

The people who evade tax boards?

Taxes. Taxes. Income taxes.

Oh, taxes . Yeah, well, so that's the weird thing. They said there
was something with my taxes. I couldn't make out the. That's the
message. Something about my taxes, but it was really broken up. I
think I got a bad reception here again.

All right. Did you pay your taxes. Have you filed your taxed.
IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 3 of 17

I filed my taxes.

You filed your taxes or your CPA files it?

I have an accountant that files it for me.

Why then he is doing many mistakes in the filing of taxes?

Why is he what? I'm sorry. I can't hear you too well.

Sir, are you doing some overseas transactions?

I have some investments.

Because according to the rules and regulations, when there are
overseas transactions under your name, you need to pay the full
portion of the transaction fees to the IRS Department, which you
never did. They have investigated each and every thing, and they
have filed a lawsuit complaint against your name.

Are you sure about that? I mean, these are just like miscellaneous

investments, and like some stocks and company stuff. It was
nothing really big. I think my accountant has taken care of all that.
Still, the transactions are being made for the overseas, and the tax
are being pending under you name for the overseas transaction. I'm
not talking about the income tax. You pay you pay your income tax
perfectly. It has been filed perfectly every year. Nothing is problem
in that. But I'm talking about the overseas transactions which are
made from your end. For that you need to pay the full portion of the
tax of amount to the IRS, which you never did. Which you never
showed at the time of your tax filing as well.

Okay. So, I mean, how much are we talking about?

It's $5,868. The pending amount under your name.

Oh my god. Okay. I mean, are we sure this is for me?

This is including the penalty amount, the late payment charges, as
well as all of the court resolution fees, because the case has
already been filed under you name.

Okay, what do you mean by a case?

IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 4 of 17
In a few days, the arrest warrant will also be issued under your
name.

An a-what?

Under your name. The arrest warrant will also be issued under your
name.

An IRS warrant?

Arrest warrant, sir. Arrest.

Arrest warrant? I got an arrest warrant under my name?

Yes. You will be getting it soon. Because you are running out of the
situation right now. You have evaded the tax, and you are under
their criminal records right now.

But I. Okay, so, I didn't do anything. I mean, I have an accountant

that takes care of this for me. So, is there something we can talk to
and just get this cleared up. I mean, I'm sure it's just a minor issue.
Sir. Are you there?

I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

Hello?

Yes.

You need to clear out the taxes, the tax amount which is pending
under your name.

Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't even catch your name.

Steve Parker.

Okay, Mr. Parker. So, I mean, here's the thing. I don't have that

type of money all in one shot. Is there something that, I don't know.
I mean, in the past if I had any taxes, I would just make a deposit
Sir? We are not Sir? We are not bill collectors. I'm not asking you
for any money from you. You are not paying this amount to me. So,
if you don't have the funds, then don't talk to me. Because I am
telling you to submit this payment to the IRS Department itself.
Because we are doing an offer in compromise with them regarding 
IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 5 of 17
your case. Because your case is being forwarded to your local
county sheriff department. You will be receiving an arrest warrant
as soon as possible. I think it will be tomorrow itself.

Okay, so, how? I don't want to go to jail. So what do I need to do to

take care of this? Who do I call?
You need to pay this amount: $5,868.

I need to pay the full amount?

Yes, the full amount. This is a compromise amount which you need
to submit.

What is compromise amount?

Offer in compromise.

Okay, is there a case number?

11/100/3636.

11/100/3636.

3636, yes.

Okay. And who do I make the payment to?

You will be making this payment .

Can you guys take a credit card?

No, we don't accept any of your credit cards, any of your debit
cards, any of your bank account information. Because you need to
pay this amount by the tax pay vouchers, which are available to any
of the government stores, federal stores nearby you. I will guide
you about the stores, but you need to have this amount cash with
you.

Okay. And what do I do? There's a tax voucher or something at one

of my local stores?
Not local stores, sir. Government stores.

Okay. What government stores would that be?

IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 6 of 17
Home Depot, Food Lion.

Okay. And what do I ask them for? You say you don't take credit

card or Visa.
You need to ask them about the tax pay vouchers . There will be
tax pay vouchers available to that store. And you just need to take
the cash over there, upload the funds from that tax pay voucher so
that we can submit that voucher to the IRS Department for the offer
in compromise. Once the payment will be submitted you will be
provided with the receipt copy as well as the clearance letter from
the IRS Department as well.

Okay, so I just go over there, put the money into a tax pay voucher

and mail it in?
Yes.

Okay. And where do I mail it to?

I will put all the information. I will write all the information. You don't
have to worry about that. First of all, you need to arrange the funds,
$5,868.

Okay. That's fine. I'm going to get that right now. Then do I mail it

in, or do I call you back. What do you need me to do, then. What
am I supposed to do?
Arrange the funds. Call me back, so I guide you to the nearest store
to you. What is your zip code, by the way.

The zip code I'm in at the moment is 30303.

Hold on. What's your zip code you told me?

I'm actually traveling. This is great.

What's the zip code you told me? What's the zip code, sir? 30 .

go there? And then, that's fine.
First you need to have cash, sir. First you need to have cash. Do
you have this amount cash with you?

Yeah, that's all I have with me at the moment.

You need to submit $2400 for the warrant cancellation fees today.

Okay. Okay. So, you'll accept that for now, and tomorrow morning I

can take care of the rest?

Yes, this is my direct line number.

Okay, Mr. Parker. Let me go run real quick, get that tax voucher.

You can be on hold with me, sir. You can be on hold so that we will
have the evidence for this recording as well that you tried your best
in order to arrange the half of the payment. Because you are not
paying this amount in one shot, right?

Yeah, but I mean, I need to go wash up real quick. If you can give

me 20 minutes. It's not exactly walking distance. I need to go drive
there. So can I call you back?
Sir, I need you to keep your phone on loudspeaker so that I am
preparing the documentation for the cancellation of the arrest

better that you keep your cell phone with you on a loudspeaker, so
that I can talk to you.

Okay. But the phone might die, getting into the elevator and stuff.

You don't have a car charger with you?

Yes, yes. I just don't have reception when I go down to the lobby in

you?

make sure I don't get arrested tomorrow. Right?
Yes, for the cancellation.

back. It will be 10 - 15 minutes, so I can go get whatever voucher it

part on the backside.

Yeah, I see it here.

Yeah, scratch it off carefully, and make sure you don't lose any
numbers. And help me out with the numbers one by one which you
can see below that.

And you want to do what?

Once you scratch it off, you will see some numbers, which is used

out with that.

Okay, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to just give

you this number?
Yeah, you have to give me those numbers.
IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 14 of 17

Oh, no. I don't know about that. Aren't I supposed to go to a

PayPal.com website or something like that for this? How do I
know 
That is a receipt copy for your information, sir, which has been
given to you. And we will just verify that. We will just mention that
you bought it from the store with phone number 3775. And if there
are some problems to verify that, we will call them and verify the
transaction.

I mean, can't I just do this. I'd feel a little bit more comfortable if I

can do this online so print out the receipt right away in case the
cops show up or something. I can at least show them, hey, look I
took care of something.
Yes, you are to bring the receipt copy with you. Sir, you are keeping
that receipt copy with you for your conformation that, yes, you are
the owner of those money packs and you made those payments.
This is what the reason .

Yeah, but you know, if the cop comes here, he's not going to care

about I got some receipt here. He's going to be like, "I got a
warrant here for your arrest unless you have something, you
know."
Yes, sir. Once you pay those off. Once we withdraw the warrant,
you will get an out of court restitution certificate. That will be Yes.

Okay, and how do I get that?

If you have a fax machine, once you make the payments, once we
withdraw the charges under your name and put your case on hold,
then they will issue an out-of-court restitution certificate. If you have
a fax machine around you, we can fax it to you. Or if you don't have
access to a fax machine, as you told me you're in a hotel, so we
can email it you.

Yeah, the lobby might have a little office place or something. But, I

don't know.
No problem. But do you have access to your email? We can scan
that copy and send it to your email as well. No problem with that.

Man, all right. I got nothing here to scratch it with. It's just crazy.

Like I said, if I could go through the IRS website and pay this
online.
IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 15 of 17
I understand your concern, sir. I understand. But the IRS would not
give you certain information. That's the whole point. As the reason
as IRS penalty accepts check. But as it was a short notice that we
need to drop these charges under your name, we need to directly
submit this payment to the restitution department, and make an
assurance that, yes, your case has been put on hold and you get
your out-of-court restitution certificate. So that we can make your
records clean and make is as clear as it was in the past.

Yeah, but all I want to do 

But sir, if you have a problem about that, I will connect this line to
Mr. Stephen Parker, and you can go and talk to him that you don't
want to make the payments, and he can do whatever he needs to
do. I'm just an accounting department guy, sir. My job is to just
submit the payments to the restitution department and guide you
how you make the payments. If you have any problems with
payments I'll connect your line to Stephen Parker.

So, if I give you this number I mean the thing is, how do I get

proof?
I promise you one thing once you help me out with numbers, I'm not
going to dominate this phone call. I will be on hold with you on the
same phone call I will forward the information to the restitution
department on their PayPal account. And unless and until you get
your out-of-court restitution certificate, I am not going to disconnect
the call from you.

Yeah, you know, no. I need to turn around. I'll feel a little more

comfortable if I can get some proof right away. You can't fax it to
me or something. I get nervous about that. I need to think about
this. I'll call you back if anything. No, no, no. I have to talk to my
accountant.
Sir, you have to tell this to Stephen Parker, sir. You have to tell this
to Stephen Parker that you're not making the payments, and he can
issue the arrest warrant or do whatever he wants to. Just hold the
line. I'll connect the line to Stephen Parker, okay? Tell him that
you're not making the payments, and we will go from there. Okay?
Just hold on for a second.

Okay. Okay.

Steve Parker.
IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 16 of 17

Yeah, Mr. Parker. I was speaking with Brian. But I can't just take

this without some type of proof on my side protecting the money
goes out. Cop comes here, knocks on my door. I can't.
I will explain everything. Okay, sir?
You are making this payment to the restitution department directly,
sir. As it was a short notice, and this was a final notification phone
call as I told you before, as well. This was a final notification phone
call. I don't want to pay this amount, sir. I told you first, as well, we
are not concerned about the amount. We are concerned about you.
Because, as we looked into your past records, you have very clean
record. You are a good citizen.

Well, I always pay my stuff on time. That's what I pay an

accountant for.
This is the reason that we have given you this final notification
phone call. If you would have been a criminal, then we would have
never given you a phone call, and we have directly served you with
an arrest warrant, sir. The reason behind the phone .

Okay, so let's me ask you a question. Can I go online somewhere,

to turn around at least see this information?
What information you want, sir? I already told you you are running
out of your time. I give you a chance in order to resolve this issue. I
will provide you time until tomorrow. But you need to cancel your
arrest warrant today, sir. If you will not pay this, I will also not be
able to help you out in this case. And you're not making your
payment.

I understand you're trying to help.

Sir, you are not making your full payment today. Then also I told
Mr. Brian Jackson that please issue him a clearance letter from the
courthouse, so that if he is in any sort of problem, he can have
proof with him that, yes, he has made a partial payment and has
the records with him. This was the reason we are trying to help you.

But my problem is I just need something so I turn around when a

cop come here, I can say, "Look. I made a payment. Here's the
case number. And here's the receipt." I just don't know. I don't
know. 
IRS Phone Scam – call transcript Page 17 of 17
Sir, I told you, sir. I told you. You will get each and everything once
they received payment. Before making the payment, how can we
provide the receipt copy and the clearance letter? How can we get
you that. Once the payments are submitted to them, within 5 to 10
minutes, your clearance letter will be coming from there, and we will
mail it to you on the same phone call. We will not disconnect this
line until the time you will not get your clearance letter. Because
you are..

I got to talk to my accountant, Mr. Parker. I appreciate it. I

understand what you're saying. But I got to talk to my accountant
and get this straightened out. I will call you in the morning, first
thing in the morning. I will call him right now.
Not a problem, sir. I think you are giving me a flat refusal. Now I
also want

I didn't understand a word you said. You're breaking up really bad.

I'm telling you, sir. We are now taking this matter in legal ways,
because I think you are running out of the situation, and I will
forward this file to your local county sheriff department right now.
And make sure if you receive any phone call from you local county
sheriff department, you receive their phone call. Because they will
come to arrest you, sir.

I want to talk to my accountant. I understand, Mr. Parker. I've just

got to take this quick chance here. But you know. I need to make
everything okay.
Not a problem. You are making a flat refusal on this recorded line,
sir. It will go against you inside the courthouse, as well. Not a
problem. Take care.

Okay. I will verify. Thank you.

Thank you.
