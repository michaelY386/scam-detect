Good day,

Every day Syrian people are faced with death and destruction. More than 5.1 million people have left their homes within Syria. 1.86 million people have fled to neighboring countries and 100,000 people have died.

Across the country, Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers and staff are risking their lives to get aid to the most vulnerable Syrians.

However, as the crisis worsens, people need more water, food, medical care, and shelter.

To continue helping people affected by the conflict, we urgently need your support.
