So you never received anything showing $5,821.00 sir?

Christine had said there was an outstanding fee of $5,000 and asked me to go to the bank, so I just walked down the street and I’m down in Santa Monica.  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with that stuff.

Can I explain you once again sir?

Okay

Okay, we have audit of your taxes between the year of 2009 and 2014.  And we find out that taxes amount to $5,821 which is late.  Right now you owe $5,821.  Now, when the case will be done within the courthouse, your bank account will be seized, your credit report will be spoiled, your passport along with State ID will be seized.

Does this affect my wife and I were about to lease a car a Daihatsu and were at the dealership tonight.  Is this going to affect that?

Sir, well I can’t hear you can you stop walking and talk to me first?

Okay, can you hear me now?

Yea, it be better

There’s artillery around here it’s weird.  I don’t understand why. I mean out of all places around here right?  Okay, is this because of the Mazda Miata, the convertible one…or because I didn’t pay it?

This is sir, because you filed taxes but your taxes have not been filed in correct for those years.  There was some problem regarding a W-2 and W-4 form.  So now regarding a W-2 and W-4 form unpaid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant on your name.  And now for this unpaid taxes, once you get arrested, your each and every property will be seized like your house, your State ID your Visa, your driver’s license.  Each and every property that belong to your name will be seized by the IRS once you get arrested.

If I own Marvin Gardens and Broadway, does the same thing happen or no?

Pardon?

If, let’s say I own the Broadway, Marvin Gardens or even the electric company does that have anything to do with this or no?

It’s regarding your Federal taxes sir.

Okay alright, then what else?

Do you have the money with you?

Yes, I have the money but I am not sure what to do with it now.

You want this matter be confidential or want this matter to be disclosed regarding your case?

I mean I probably want it confidential

Okay how much time to reach you back sir?

If I ask my boss I have a shift duty that ends uh, after the hippopotamus cage gets cleaned, I can probably go after the feeding, just before the raptors and if I go before the raptors then I can probably go in about an hour. Is that good?

No sir because once I hang up this call you are sure to be arrested.  You will be arrested from your work place sir.  So what do you have to do is take a leave right now sir.

I know but I have a boss that is not going to let me out of my office just yet.  They haven’t even fed the animals the animals haven’t even been fed yet.  Like I don’t know what I’m supposed to do I can’t just leave now but I can talk to my boss and ask him if he can let me go if I come back and at least get him some sort of a sausage sandwich and maybe a Slurpee he’ll be open for it, you know?

Pardon?

I said if I can at least offer my boss you know tell him what I’m doing, hopefully he’ll totally understand what I’m trying to do here cause I can’t get in trouble again.  Not with that mess of stuff I did before.

Now if you can speak to your boss that you are getting an arrest warrant, don’t you think your job will be as risk? 

Yea, that’s why I have to go and talk to him about it.

So that’s why you have to go to him, say you’re having an emergency so you have to leave for the house you have to leave for an hour. 

Okay, this sounds like a good plan I’m going to walk into his office but I hope it’s okay.  He actually just fired somebody.  I gotta be careful.  The last person he fired I don’t even know why but I am going to talk to him to see if I can convince him Okay wish me luck I’m going to be back in just a minute.
