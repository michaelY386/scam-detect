Sir, I told you, sir. I told you. You will get each and everything once
they received payment. Before making the payment, how can we
provide the receipt copy and the clearance letter? How can we get
you that. Once the payments are submitted to them, within 5 to 10
minutes, your clearance letter will be coming from there, and we will
mail it to you on the same phone call. We will not disconnect this
line until the time you will not get your clearance letter. Because
you are..
I got to talk to my accountant, Mr. Parker. I appreciate it. I
understand what you're saying. But I got to talk to my accountant
and get this straightened out. I will call you in the morning, first
thing in the morning. I will call him right now.
Not a problem, sir. I think you are giving me a flat refusal. Now I
also want...(unitelligible)
I didn't understand a word you said. You're breaking up really bad.
I'm telling you, sir. We are now taking this matter in legal ways,
because I think you are running out of the situation, and I will
forward this file to your local county sheriff department right now.
And make sure if you receive any phone call from you local county
sheriff department, you receive their phone call. Because they will
come to arrest you, sir.
I want to talk to my accountant. I understand, Mr. Parker. I've just
got to take this quick chance here. But you know. I need to make
everything okay.
Not a problem. You are making a flat refusal on this recorded line,
sir. It will go against you inside the courthouse, as well. Not a
problem. Take care.
Okay. I will verify. Thank you.
Thank you.
