Okay. Okay. So, you'll accept that for now, and tomorrow morning I
can take care of the rest?
Yes.
 Okay. Okay. When I call back, is this your direct number, or...
Yes, this is my direct line number.
 Okay, Mr. Parker. Let me go run real quick, get that tax voucher.
You can be on hold with me, sir. You can be on hold so that we will
have the evidence for this recording as well that you tried your best
in order to arrange the half of the payment. Because you are not
paying this amount in one shot, right?
Yeah, but I mean, I need to go wash up real quick. If you can give
me 20 minutes. It's not exactly walking distance. I need to go drive
there. So can I call you back?
Sir, I need you to keep your phone on loudspeaker so that I am
preparing the documentation for the cancellation of the arrest
warrant. If I have any queries regarding, I need to ask you. So it's
better that you keep your cell phone with you on a loudspeaker, so
that I can talk to you.
