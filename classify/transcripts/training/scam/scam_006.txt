Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are

work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.
