Okay. And who do I make the payment to?
You will be making this payment....
 Can you guys take a credit card?
No, we don't accept any of your credit cards, any of your debit
cards, any of your bank account information. Because you need to
pay this amount by the tax pay vouchers, which are available to any
of the government stores, federal stores nearby you. I will guide
you about the stores, but you need to have this amount cash with
you.
 Okay. And what do I do? There's a tax voucher or something at one
of my local stores?
Not local stores, sir. Government stores.
 Okay. What government stores would that be?

 Okay. And what do I ask them for? You say you don't take credit
card or Visa.
You need to ask them about the tax pay vouchers . There will be
tax pay vouchers available to that store. And you just need to take
the cash over there, upload the funds from that tax pay voucher so
that we can submit that voucher to the IRS Department for the offer
in compromise. Once the payment will be submitted you will be
provided with the receipt copy as well as the clearance letter from
the IRS Department as well.
