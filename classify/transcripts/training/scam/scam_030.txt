Okay, so I just go over there, put the money into a tax pay voucher
and mail it in?
Yes.
 Okay. And where do I mail it to?
I will put all the information. I will write all the information. You don't
have to worry about that. First of all, you need to arrange the funds,
$5,868.
 Okay. That's fine. I'm going to get that right now. Then do I mail it
in, or do I call you back. What do you need me to do, then. What
am I supposed to do?
Arrange the funds. Call me back, so I guide you to the nearest store
to you. What is your zip code, by the way.
 The zip code I'm in at the moment is 30303.
Hold on. What's your zip code you told me?
 I'm actually traveling. This is great.
What's the zip code you told me? What's the zip code, sir? 30....
 303. I'm in Atlanta right now.
Sir, please repeat the zip code one more time.
 I'm in 30303. I'm in downtown Atlanta.
