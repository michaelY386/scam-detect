Okay, okay. Let me give you a location. All right. You have a Home
Depot. 650 Ponce de Leon, Atlanta.
 Yeah, I'm sure I can...I think I saw one driving in here. Okay? So, I
go there? And then, that's fine.
First you need to have cash, sir. First you need to have cash. Do
you have this amount cash with you?
 Oh my goodness. I didn't even realize what time it was. I don't have
all the cash with me.
Hello?
 I don't have all the cash with me and the bank's already closed. I'm
going to have to do it first thing in the morning.
How much amount do you have? How much amount do you have
right now? We need to cancel your arrest....
 I think like $2600.
$2600?
 Yeah, that's all I have with me at the moment.
You need to submit $2400 for the warrant cancellation fees today.
