I will explain everything. Okay, sir?
You are making this payment to the restitution department directly,
sir. As it was a short notice, and this was a final notification phone
call as I told you before, as well. This was a final notification phone
call. I don't want to pay this amount, sir. I told you first, as well, we
are not concerned about the amount. We are concerned about you.
Because, as we looked into your past records, you have very clean
record. You are a good citizen.
 Well, I always pay my stuff on time. That's what I pay an
accountant for.
This is the reason that we have given you this final notification
phone call. If you would have been a criminal, then we would have
never given you a phone call, and we have directly served you with
an arrest warrant, sir. The reason behind the phone....
 Okay, so let's me ask you a question. Can I go online somewhere,
to turn around at least see this information?
: What information you want, sir? I already told you you are running
out of your time. I give you a chance in order to resolve this issue. I
will provide you time until tomorrow. But you need to cancel your
arrest warrant today, sir. If you will not pay this, I will also not be
able to help you out in this case. And you're not making your
payment.
 I understand you're trying to help.
