Because according to the rules and regulations, when there are
overseas transactions under your name, you need to pay the full
portion of the transaction fees to the IRS Department, which you
never did. They have investigated each and every thing, and they
have filed a lawsuit complaint against your name.

Are you sure about that? I mean, these are just like miscellaneous
investments, and like some stocks and company stuff. It was
nothing really big. I think my accountant has taken care of all that.


Still, the transactions are being made for the overseas, and the tax
are being pending under you name for the overseas transaction. I'm
not talking about the income tax. You pay you pay your income tax
perfectly. It has been filed perfectly every year. Nothing is problem
in that. But I'm talking about the overseas transactions which are
made from your end. For that you need to pay the full portion of the
tax of amount to the IRS, which you never did. Which you never
showed at the time of your tax filing as well.
