No problem. But do you have access to your email? We can scan
that copy and send it to your email as well. No problem with that.
 Man, all right. I got nothing here to scratch it with. It's just crazy.

online.
IRS Phone Scam â€“ call transcript Page 15 of 17
I understand your concern, sir. I understand. But the IRS would not
give you certain information. That's the whole point. As the reason
as IRS penalty accepts check. But as it was a short notice that we
need to drop these charges under your name, we need to directly
submit this payment to the restitution department, and make an
assurance that, yes, your case has been put on hold and you get
your out-of-court restitution certificate. So that we can make your
records clean and make is as clear as it was in the past.
 Yeah, but all I want to do...
But sir, if you have a problem about that, I will connect this line to
Mr. Stephen Parker, and you can go and talk to him that you don't
want to make the payments, and he can do whatever he needs to
do. I'm just an accounting department guy, sir. My job is to just
submit the payments to the restitution department and guide you
how you make the payments. If you have any problems with
payments...I'll connect your line to Stephen Parker.
 So, if I give you this number...I mean the thing is, how do I get
proof?
I promise you one thing once you help me out with numbers, I'm not
going to dominate this phone call. I will be on hold with you on the
same phone call I will forward the information to the restitution
department on their PayPal account. And unless and until you get
your out-of-court restitution certificate, I am not going to disconnect
the call from you
