Obviously, in such a political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.

Given current trends, particularly in demographics, such conflict won't
be military.  Europe wouldn't stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry.

Not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldn't stand united.
That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is
the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of
the new ideology of transnational progressivism.

Now that is a scary thought.
