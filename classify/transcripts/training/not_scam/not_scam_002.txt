What to choose for Core i5 64 bits? If you have other i386 machines around,
it may be convenient for you to keep the same architecture so you can share the
download bandwidth of Debian updates, and things like that.
On the other hand, now might be a good time to begin the migration to the
future.  32-bits will be around for a long time, but it will increasingly be
relegated to older hardware and niche applications, such as embedded
processors or cell phones and the like.  64-bits is going to be the
"current" architecture for desktops, servers, and the like for a good while
to come.

That's true.  I used to say and think that ... back around 1992 when
I started to use DEC Alpha machines.  But now that 2GB is about as
little RAM as you can get in a new machine, the push to move to 64bit is
very real.
