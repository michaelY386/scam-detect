Secondhand books online

I've used this a few times and can thoroughly recommend it. It really 
does work. Frankly, the only drawback is finding too much stuff.

I'll be amazed if there's anyone on here who isn't already a heavy user!

Be amazed - I've never bought anything online since an almighty cock up
with amazon a few years back where I lost
all the dosh I'd paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
it been the UK branch I'd have had them in the small claims court
quicker than you could drop a book on your foot and say "ouch", but as it
was the US branch I'd just not come back.
