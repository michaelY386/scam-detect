But will probably not work in you case, as it was meant to combine two (or more?) network ports from the same computer connected to the same switch.
The description says

The Linux bonding driver provides a method for aggregating
multiple network interfaces into a single logical
bonded  interface.

Strictly speaking, this is what I want. Now, your interpretation seems
to be based on the definition of a link aggregation, which I am not
really familiar with. Basically, I want to merge connections into one,
or at least divide and use them separately, in an easy way. This is not
a so rare situation, is it? E.g. you might be wandering in some zone
where you can use the WiFi, but where it is sometimes unavailable, say
at specific regions. If you manage to use another connection, for
example the one that is given by your mobile phone/smartphone /via/
Bluetooth (which is then connected to the internet through other
protocols), it should be possible to switch between these two
connections, or to use them simultaneously, if, say, WiFi 's range is
too small or WiFi's bandwidth too small compared to the smartphone's
one. (Okay, this is not a really realistic example.)
You might also share an internet connection with your neighbour,
legally, and use it a lot when he does not need it. Then, if you already
use ethernet, you can use both connections. But how?

Bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is layer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some technology that can be bonded (like ADSL).

As far as I understand what you need is BGP, but I can't give you any tips as this is way out of my league ;)

Probably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a=20
GNU/Linux (preferably Debian) machine connected to both internet links=20
and your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more=20
than one WAN port.
