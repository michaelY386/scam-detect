They aren't selling the software, which is pretty pricy as
it happens.  They are using it to optimize next generation
wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a
large scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro
wireless configurations, some of which generate far more dead
or marginal spots and others which are very expensive to
operate (due to backhaul transit considerations) or both.  This
software can be used as a tool to optimize the canopy coverage
and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless is
tied into fiber at multiple points.

So you only need to map a handful of metropolitan areas?
