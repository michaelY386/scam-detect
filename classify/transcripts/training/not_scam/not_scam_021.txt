The New York Times and Los Angeles
Times
both lead with word that
a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest
national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas
from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01.
The judge concluded that El Paso left twenty one percent of its capacity
in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and
helping to induce rolling blackouts.

and this is the product of overregulation?

I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission
prices could have hit fifty dollars.

But I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run
a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.
We had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.

So maybe the judge has a point.  We'll see as the appeals work its way
out.
