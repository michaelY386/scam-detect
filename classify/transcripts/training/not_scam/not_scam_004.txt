This is GREAT!  Thank you!  This is exactly what I was thinking about as the best solution whether I expressed it well or not. There are a couple of problems bugs that I 
haven't had time to fully characterize yet, but I don't care.  We can work out 
the problems at least we have the functionality. Thanks again.
