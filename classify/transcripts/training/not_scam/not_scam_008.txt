I would like to know if people here have the same problems with this technology as I do. I haven't looked for
problems filled about it yet, but these issues have been annoying for time enough to put me wondering if I'am the only who has been
facing them.

I've had other weird problems with the collection (like missing albums) after an upgrade. This was due to database
corruption, and the fix was to destroy the database.

In my experience it's probably better to use something else because it's faster. Anyhow, it still 
happens that the changes you make to the tracks and albums don't show immediately
